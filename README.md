🏨 Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis This project explores and analyzes an Airbnb listings dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to derive insights about host behaviors, listing features, and customer preferences through data cleaning, filtering, and visualization.

📌 Objective To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb property data to uncover patterns and insights.

📁 Dataset The dataset used is Airbnb_Data.csv, which contains information on hosts, property details, amenities, review scores, and more.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
🔍 Key Features

Handled missing values and formatted date and text data
Filtered listings by amenities, review scores, and host credibility
Identified patterns in top-rated listings, verified hosts, and family-friendly properties
Created insightful visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
📈 Sample Insights -High ratings are more frequent in specific cities, especially where listings have more amenities and verified hosts.

-Listings with WiFi and multiple bedrooms are more likely to have better reviews — indicating comfort and utility are key for travelers.

-Host credibility (verification + profile picture) plays a significant role in trust and visibility.

-Instant booking is a highly valued feature — filtered together with other host factors for refined listing analysis.

-Room type availability shows what kind of spaces are most commonly listed (entire homes vs. shared rooms).

-Cancellation policy and pricing can influence review scores — explored using median-based stats.
